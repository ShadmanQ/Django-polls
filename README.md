Getting my feet with Django

Currently following the [tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/) on Django's website 


What I've learned so far:
- setup of the Django enviornment
- creating superusers/admin accounts
- fundamentals of the models/views system Django utilizes
- using these views to redirect to a new webpage
- creating generic views for basic webpages
